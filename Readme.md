# Voice assistant with features

### Introduction
This Voice assistant may be useful for people who want a little automation in their daily tasks. What makes it even a little more futuristic - you have all processes controlled by your voice.


### Basic idea of realization
- As TTS engine I would use pyttsx3, the most advanced TTS engine I could find for this purpose.
- As Speech recognition framework I would use SpeechRecognition.
- To remove all the noises and get users output I would use fuzzywuzzy.
- Pytest for testing.
